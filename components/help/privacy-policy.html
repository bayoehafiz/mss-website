                    <li><i class="fa  fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information.</strong> For example, our services require you to fill up a form to get a MSS Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your company name, email address, telephone number or NPWP number to store with your account. We might also ask you to create common informations, which may include your name and photo.
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="fa  fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Website Visitors.</strong> Like most website operators, MSS collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MSS’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MSS’s visitors use its website. From time to time, MSS may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
                        <br> MSS also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs. MSS only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

                    <li><i class="fa  fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Aggregated Statistics.</strong> MSS may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, MSS may monitor the most popular blogs on the WordPress.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. MSS may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, MSS does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="fa  fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information.</strong> MSS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MSS’s behalf or to provide services available at MSS’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using MSS’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. MSS will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, MSS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when MSS believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MSS, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an MSS website and have supplied your email address, MSS may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with MSS and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MSS takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

                    <li><i class="fa  fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. MSS uses cookies to help MSS identify and track visitors, their usage of MSS website, and their website access preferences. MSS visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using MSS’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of MSS’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

                    <li><i class="fa  fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Privacy Policy Changes.</strong> Although most changes are likely to be minor, MSS may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in MSS’s sole discretion. MSS encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
